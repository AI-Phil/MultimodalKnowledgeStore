    "Rajasthan, home to the golden sand dunes, is a haven for desert camps in India. For the erstwhile Maharajas, campaigning in distant lands meant long stays in desert camps. During wars or expeditions, camps were the only luxury available and soon these “homes away from home” evolved into mobile, mini-palaces.\n",
    "Today, Rajasthan offers a wonderful selection of desert camps, to create the ideal nomadic desert retreat. Most camps offer camel and jeep safaris to nearby villages and evening entertainment with bon fire, local musicians & dancers, puppet shows, juggling, and other regional performances.\n",
